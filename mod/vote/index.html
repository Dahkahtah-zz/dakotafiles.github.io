<h2>Reasons:</h2><hr><br>
<h3>Riesenkalmar</h3>
- From my experience with him on our personal adventure map server, he is very selfish and tampers around with everything to make it suit him.<br>
- Imo he's far too imature and young.<br>
- Seen many instances of what could be considered sexual harassment on Cheeky_Chook. Jokes or not, he does it a lot and it's pretty creepy.
<br><br>
<h3>AbandonedBank</h3>
- A bit too full of himself and doesn't like the community too much.<br>
- Pretty self explanatory
<br><br>
<h3>Ahri Atari</h3>
- Said something about not working well in teams, social issues.<br>
- Not the best at teamwork
<br><br>
<h3>Mekyr</h3>
- He's already builder and GM, but I don't think he does either too often. He'd probably ignore mod work.<br>
- This guy is loaded with stuff already. Plus, he is a bit immature and unreliable at times.
<br><br>
<h3>Akeldebakel</h3>
- Seen a few instances of sexual harassment on Cheeky_Chook, mostly just goes along with Riesenkalmar though.
<br><br>
<h3>Beefandleather</h3>
- Last year he was part of a group of guys that were harassing Tiffany and he got a ban for it. Not sure if it's entirely important (as it was a year ago) but worth mentioning and puts me off to having him on board.
<br><br>
<h3>GudidiMC</h3>
- Inactive
<br><br>
<h3>Headset_0</h3>
- He gives me a bit of a vibe of being a kid with a bit of a superiority complex. Not entirely sure about it though.
<br><br>
<h3>Mular5</h3>
- Can't put my finger on why, possibly too immature...
<br><br>
<h3>Plato3</h3>
- This guy rubs me the wrong way... I don't exactly trust him.
